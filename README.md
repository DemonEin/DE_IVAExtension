## Special Thanks
Thanks to alexustas, creator of the amazing ASET Props Pack which this mod is based on, and of course his beautiful ALCOR capsule, from which much of the prop layout was shamelessly taken

Thanks to MOARdV, creater of RasterPropMonitor, which makes the IVAs interactive in the first place
